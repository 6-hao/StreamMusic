## Car & TV Editions {#more-platform}

No standalone car edition planned. The current version supports phone/tablet interfaces and should work on car infotainment systems if installable.  

If your car system supports navigation via **directional keys + OK key + back key** with a landscape screen, try switching to **TV mode** on the login page.  

Apple TV Edition may begin adaptation in v1.4.0 after feasibility research, but **no guarantee of release**.

## HarmonyOS Next (Native) Adaptation {#ohos}

Stream Music is built with Flutter (a Google product), making **official Flutter support for HarmonyOS highly unlikely**.  

~~Personal bandwidth limitations prevent dedicated HarmonyOS adaptation.~~  

:::info  

OpenHarmony is reportedly working on Flutter compatibility, leaving future HarmonyOS support possible.

## New Music Services {#protocols}

- **QNAP Music Station** support planned.  
- **WebDAV**, cloud storage, and local music support are **not currently planned** (long-term roadmap items).
