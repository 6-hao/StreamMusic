# Focus on a Specific Type of Audio {#focus}

In addition to storing music, we may also add audiobooks and other audio types to our library.

While this can expand the use of Yinliu, it also introduces a new issueâ€”we may not want to see these special types of audio in places like daily recommendations or smart playlists, as they can interrupt our current music listening experience.

To solve this problem, we can either choose to set up a server that supports media library partitions, such as Emby and Jellyfin, or use Docker to set up another server specifically for storing these special types of audio.

By isolating these special audio files in different libraries or partitions, we can take advantage of **Yinliu's ability to switch libraries and partitions** to focus on listening to music or audiobooks.
